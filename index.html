            <h4>I get too much credit for having good grades and being smart while there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of people who are better as a person and way smarter than me, so take time to actually learn people, don't make vague assumptions. That doesn't mean I'm dumb though.</h4>

            <h4>If you do need help and you think I'm the best person for the job, I'll write essays, memoirs, do your math homework, anything, <span id="sspt">(I need something in return like maybe a small bag of takis or a dollar for ice cream, I don't really know.)</span>, just hit me up whenever.
